DESCRIPTION
I built a CMS- style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. I built this site completely from scractch and deployed it to heroku. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
